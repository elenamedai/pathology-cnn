# Pathology CNN Project

This is my first project in **computational pathology**.  
I am learning how to use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify medical images.

## Goals
- Learn GitHub basics
- Understand CNNs in image classification
- Apply deep learning to pathology-related datasets

## Project Steps
1. Load dataset (example: histology images from public dataset)
2. Preprocess images (resize, normalize)
3. Train a CNN model (Keras/TensorFlow)
4. Evaluate performance (accuracy, AUC)
5. Visualize results (heatmaps, confusion matrix)

## Tools
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- MONAI (for medical imaging)

## Results
(to be added after training the model)
